# CommunityBot

This is a discord bot created for the hack week.
I'm french, so the bot is in french. Sorry for that.
This is a discord.py bot, to create mini-communities of people with similar interests.
In servers different from the one it manages, you can only start the questionnaire (start_quest).
Then we answer the latter, and he classifies us in a channel with whom we share the answers.
This is the first version, some features are missing, which will be added over time.
You need to configure the server id and the invite he manage.

I tried to find an idea related to the discord universe, I hope you will enjoy it.

Have a good day.
