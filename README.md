# CommunityBot

This is a discord bot created for the hack week.
I'm french, so the bot is in french. Sorry for that.
This is a discord.py bot, to create mini-communities of people with similar interests.
In servers different from the one it manages, you can only start the questionnaire (start_quest).
Then we answer the latter, and he classifies us in a channel with whom we share the answers.
This is the first version, some features are missing, which will be added over time.

You need to configure the server id and the invite he manage.
The role of members must be set up so that they do not see unauthorized channels.

you need two servers: one that the bot will manage, and another random to start the questionnaire.
In the end, the bot is made to be present on any server, but to gather communities on a single one.

I tried to find an idea related to the discord universe, I hope you will enjoy it.

Have a good day.
